In general, the methods in the Set have the lowest levels of Coverage (average), as its 80% for missed instructions, against 79% for Euroimillion classes, and 72% Coverage for missed branches, against 75% for Euromillion classes.
Talking with more detail in each group:
- As for the Set group, there is only one test file, with the methods add(int), intersects(SetOfNaturals) and equals(Object) with the lowest Coverage levels:

equals(Object)	            619	                    76%	    33	                50%	    3	    4	    3	    8	    0	    1

- As for the Euromillions group, there are three test files, with CouponEuromillions with the least Coverage (40% and 0%), followed by Dip (86% and 71%) and EuromillionDraw (90% and 100%). As we only modified the Dip files, it's the only test worthy of talking about.

As we can see, the methods shown aren't perfect as they still get some missed instructions and branches, meaning that even though they have a high coverage level, they still make some mistakes, letting some values and some alternatvies go through.
